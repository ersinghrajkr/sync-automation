In Case of MULTIPLE THREADS DEPENDENT ON ONE ANOTHER based on SEQUENCE/ORDER they are defined
Under Test Plan - check the checkbox: Run Threads consecutively (i.e one at a time in order/sequence they are defined)

Under Test Plan - uncheck the checkbox: Run Threads consecutively - to run threads in parallel

******************************************************************************************************************************

No Of Threads => No of User/Visitor to the application     => 50


Ramp-Up Period ( In Seconds) => 100


It means:    Ramp-Up Period ( In Seconds)/No Of Threads	
		=> 100/50 = 2sec i.e each user will take 2 seconds to start one by one
Each thread/user/visitor will start executing our sampler which in defined in our test plan



when the last sampler is finished. Then threads starts over again if there in another loop count else thread/user/visitor SHUTS DOWN

So, one loop count means threads/users/visitors will execute sampler only ones

So, Two loop count means threads/users/visitors will execute sampler Twice

So, N loop count means threads/users/visitors will execute sampler N Times

Loop Count: Infinite/FOREVER
This can be controlled by scheduler/thread lifetime

Duration: 60seconds


Action to be taken after a Sampler error:

Continue	Start next Thread Loop	Stop Thread	Stop Test Now

CONFIG ELEMENTS: 

1> HTTP Request Defaults:  Add this to avoid duplicate data under http sampler
for example:  server name/ IP / host/domain/base_url => www.demoblaze.com 
protocols: https

2> HTTP Header Manager: let's us add or override HTTP Header, it specifies list of headers will be added to the HTTP Samplers on the
JMeter Test Plan.

The header will be added to all the http sampler which are under the scope of that HTTP Header Manager

3> HTTP Cache Manager: The http Cache Manager is used to add caching functionality

for each virtual user thread it stores max 5000 number of elements in cache

3> HTTP Cookie Manager:  
Cookie can be added manually to the cookie manager. Adding cookie manually to the cooike manager will be shared by all thread groups
If the http sampler receives cookie in response then
Cookie Manager will store the session info and sends it to all subsquent http sampler in a thread

3> DNS Cache Manager: Resolves the domain name to IP
Cached resolved DNS can be cleared after with each iteration by checking the checkbox
System DNS or Custom DNS can be used to resolve the domain names to IP address
In case of system DNS. it will use host OS to resolve Domain Names

*************************************************************************************************************************
Listeners - HTTP Request Sampler
Server Name / IP
parameters
body data
file upload
http request method
path
protocols( default - http, https)
port - http-80, https-443

Redirects Automatically ( doesn't follows the redirects path)
Follows Redirects ( follows the redirects ( respone code -302 ) path
Use multipart/form-data

client implementations
Timeouts
Response
Proxy Server


*************************************************************************************************************************
Listeners - commonly used elements

Listener literally listens to what is happening in the Test
The listenrs are the components that displays the results


There is more - 
JMeters listeners enables us to monitor the request sent from JMeter as well to analyze the responses received from the system under the test

All listeners collects the same data just the difference is at presentations level
